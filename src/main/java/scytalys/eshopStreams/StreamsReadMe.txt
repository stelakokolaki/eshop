Let’s delve into the world of Java streams.

Java Streams were introduced in Java 8 and provide a powerful way to process collections of objects. Here are the key points about streams:

What is a Stream?
A stream in Java is a sequence of objects that supports various methods.
It allows you to express and process collections of data.
Streams can be created from collections, arrays, or I/O channels.
Features of Java Streams:
A stream is not a data structure; it takes input from other sources.
Streams don’t modify the original data structure; they provide results based on pipelined methods.
Intermediate operations transform a stream into another stream.
Terminal operations mark the end of the stream and return the final result.
Intermediate Operations:
These operations are chained together and transform a stream.
Examples:
map(): Applies a function to each element and returns a new stream.
Java

List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(2, 3, 4, 5);
List<Integer> squares = numbers.stream().map(x -> x * x).collect(Collectors.toList());

filter(): Selects elements based on a given predicate.
Java

List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Reflection", "Collection", "Stream");
List<String> filteredNames = names.stream().filter(s -> s.startsWith("S")).collect(Collectors.toList());

Terminal Operations:
These operations return the final result.
Examples:
sorted(): Sorts the stream.
Java

List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Reflection", "Collection", "Stream");
List<String> sortedNames = names.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.toList());

Benefits of Using Streams:
No storage: Streams don’t store all values upfront.
Pipeline of functions: You can chain multiple operations.
Laziness: Computation occurs on demand.
Parallelization: Streams can be processed in parallel.
Creation from various sources: Collections, arrays, files, etc.
In summary, Java streams provide a concise and expressive way to manipulate data. They allow you to perform operations like filtering, mapping, reducing, and sorting efficiently.
